Within the subfolders is code used to compute the confluent and Gauss hypergeometric functions, using numerical methods discussed in the submitted article:

J. W. Pearson, S. Olver, and M. A. Porter, Numerical Methods for the Computation of the Confluent and Gauss Hypergeometric Functions, submitted, 2014.

For full details of the methods used, we refer to this paper and the references therein.

- The subfolder HypFunM contains codes used to compute the confluent hypergeometric function \mathbf{M}(a;b;z) (and _1F_1(a;b;z)).
- The subfolder HypFunF contains codes used to compute the Gauss hypergeometric function \mathbf{F}(a,b;c;z) (and _2F_1(a,b;c;z)).
